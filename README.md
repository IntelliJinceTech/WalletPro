# My Awesome Project
The next optimization web app for our daily credit card purchases without compromising security and data.  


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express, Tailwind, MongoDB

A single page application primarily utilizing the MERN stack but also incorporating self-made APIs using Java, Spring, and PostgreSQL. This application utilizes custom hooks, axios, and dynamic forms to enhance the interactions within the application. Along with the frontend, I use Mongoose to manage the database connection and Express to manage the routing. Using these technologies allows for MVC to some extent where the view is React. 

## Optimizations
The next steps are centered around state management once state becomes more complicated. 


## Lessons Learned:

I broke things - a lot. And it became a learning exercise to learn the ins and outs of new libraries, technologies, and frameworks. It helped me learn more nuances with React with render cycles. It helped me learn that state and setting state are asynchronous operations that would need a useEffect or other function to allow console logs to work properly in catching updated state. 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
