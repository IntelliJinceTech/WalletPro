## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express, Tailwind, MongoDB

A single page application primarily utilizing the MERN stack but also incorporating self-made APIs using Spring, Java, and PostgreSQL and other technologies. This application utilizes custom hooks, axios, and dynamic forms to enhance the interactions within the application. Along with the frontend, I use Mongoose to manage the database connection and Express to manage the routing. Using these technologies allows for different data consumption strategies and availabilities.

## Optimizations
As this is in the state of MVP, there are many optimizations that can be applied to WalletPro to both scale and optimize the application. Firstly, we can use Redux to scale and optimize how state is being passed throughout the application. With Redux or even Recoil, a lot of the code will also be reduced so that boilerplate code can be limited. 


## Lessons Learned:

I broke things - a lot. And it became a learning exercise to learn the ins and outs of new libraries, technologies, and frameworks. It helped me learn more nuances with React with render cycles. It helped me learn that state and setting state are asynchronous operations that would need a useEffect or other function to allow console logs to work properly in catching updated state.
